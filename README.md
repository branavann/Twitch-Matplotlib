# Twitch-Matplotlib

This project focused on combining data analysis and visualisation skills together to achieve meaningful insights from a large dataset.

Specifically, this project begins by using SQL to analyze and sort through the dataset provided by Twitch (800,00 entries). 

Following the initial analysis, matplotlib was used to visually display important trends and information.
